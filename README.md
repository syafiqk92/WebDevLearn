# Wireframe

## What is a Wireframe for a Website Layout?
A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. It focuses on the layout, structure, and placement of elements on the page without worrying about colors, fonts, or detailed design. Think of it as a blueprint for your website.

Wireframes help you:
- Plan the structure and navigation of your website.
- Visualize where content (e.g., text, images, buttons) will go.
- Communicate your ideas before diving into coding.

## How to Create a Wireframe

1. Decide on the Tools
- Paper and Pencil: Quick and easy for sketching.
- Digital Tools:
   - Figma (free and popular for UI/UX design).
   - Adobe XD.
   - Balsamiq (great for low-fidelity wireframes).
   - Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides (for simple layouts).

2. Identify Key Pages
Based on your project, you’ll need wireframes for:

Homepage: Includes navigation, welcome message, and links to other sections.
About Page: A section for your bio and personal details.
Experience Page: A list of your work experience.
Education Page: Your academic background.
Skills Page: A showcase of your skills.
Contact Page: A form or details for reaching you.
3. Plan the Layout
Header: Add your name/logo and navigation links.
Main Content: Divide into sections (e.g., welcome message, about, experience).
Footer: Include contact info or social media links.
4. Sketch the Wireframe
Use boxes, lines, and placeholders to represent elements.
Example for the homepage:
5. Iterate and Refine
Share your wireframe with others for feedback.
Adjust based on usability and content needs.
